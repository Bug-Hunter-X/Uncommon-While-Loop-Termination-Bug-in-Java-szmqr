# Uncommon While Loop Termination Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Java while loops, especially when combined with conditional break statements. The `BuggyWhileLoop.java` file contains a while loop that may not behave as expected due to an error in the loop termination or increment logic.

The `FixedWhileLoop.java` file provides a corrected version of the code. This example highlights the importance of thoroughly testing loop conditions and increment/decrement logic to avoid unexpected behavior and program errors.
